## Development Guidelines

### Simplicity Principles

- Start with the minimal viable feature
- Use plain JavaScript (no TypeScript)
- Avoid external libraries unless absolutely necessary
- Keep database queries simple and direct
- Use server-side rendering where possible

### Quality Standards

- Document all actions in docs/activity.md
- Test each feature thoroughly before moving to next
- Keep code clean and well-commented
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Implement proper error handling

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper session management
- Add HTTPS in production
- Follow secure file handling practices
