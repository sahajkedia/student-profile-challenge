# Cursor.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

1. Initial Analysis and Planning
   First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md.
2. Todo List Structure
   The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them.
3. Plan Verification
   Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Task Execution
   Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Communication
   Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made.
6. Simplicity Principle
   Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Process Documentation
   Every time you perform actions related to the project, write a log of your actions to docs/activity.md and read that file whenever you find it necessary to assist you.
8. Review Process
   Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
