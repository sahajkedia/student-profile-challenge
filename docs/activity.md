## 2024-01-[Current Date] - Project Initialization

### Analysis Phase

**Time**: Project start
**Action**: Initial project analysis and planning
**Description**:

- Read and analyzed all project documentation (CURSOR.md, requirements.md, tech-stack.md, README.md)
- Understood project scope: web-based student profile and goal tracking system
- Identified simplified tech stack requirements per tech-stack.md
- Created comprehensive development plan structured in 4 phases

### Key Findings:

- **Simplified Tech Stack**: React (plain JS), Express.js, MariaDB, Bootstrap, session-based auth
- **Development Approach**: Monolithic architecture, minimal dependencies, simplicity first
- **Core Features**: Authentication, profile management, surveys, file upload, basic analytics
- **Security**: FERPA compliance, BLOB storage in database, session management

### Planning Phase

**Time**: Project start  
**Action**: Created detailed development plan
**Description**:

- Structured development into 4 phases as per requirements
- Phase 1: Core MVP (authentication, profiles, file upload)
- Phase 2: Survey system (creation, distribution, responses)
- Phase 3: Analytics & reporting (dashboards, search, export)
- Phase 4: Enhancements (advanced features, optimization)
- Created comprehensive todo list with 60+ specific tasks

### File Structure Created:

- `tasks/todo.md` - Comprehensive development plan and task list
- `docs/activity.md` - This activity log file

### Development Principles Established:

- **Simplicity First**: Minimal complexity, maximum maintainability
- **Incremental Development**: Small, testable changes
- **Documentation**: Log all actions and decisions
- **Security**: Proper validation, session management, FERPA compliance
